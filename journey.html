                <h3>Early Life &amp; Education</h3>
                <p>Born on July 31, 2003, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, my early years were shaped by a curious mind and a growing fascination with how things work. Growing up in Addis Ababa, I was immersed in a vibrant culture and a rapidly evolving technological landscape, which sparked my initial interest in technology.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am pursuing my Computer Science degree at Unity University. My studies have provided me with a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and computer systems. This academic journey is crucial in building the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue my passion for creating impactful technological solutions.</p>

                <h3>Professional Experiences &amp; Growth</h3>
                <p>My journey in the tech world is actively unfolding through practical experiences. I am currently an intern at ICOG Labs, where I am gaining valuable hands-on experience in software development and AI applications. This internship allows me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects and collaborate with experienced professionals.</p>
                <p>During my first week, I attended an orientation where I was introduced to the company's mission, projects, and expectations. This session provided insight into the workflow at ICOG Labs and set the foundation for my internship experience.</p>
                <p>On the first Saturday of my internship, I participated in a training session on MeTTa, a powerful declarative programming language. This training helped me understand the fundamentals of MeTTa and how it can be used in AI-related tasks.</p>
                <p>Following the training, I updated my CV to better reflect my skills, experiences, and the new knowledge I was gaining at ICOG Labs. The process of updating my CV involved refining my technical skills, structuring my experiences more effectively, and ensuring that my profile stood out in the tech industry.</p>
                <p>Shortly after, I received my first assignment related to MeTTa. This assignment consisted of four tasks, each designed to deepen my understanding of the language and its practical applications. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience in problem-solving, logical structuring, and implementing AI concepts using MeTTa.</p>

                <h3>Interests &amp; Skills</h3>
                <p>Beyond my formal education and internships, I am deeply passionate about several areas within technology. As a full-stack developer, I enjoy the challenge of building complete applications, from front-end user interfaces to back-end systems and databases. This holistic approach to development allows me to understand and contribute to every layer of a project.</p>
                <p>My enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence is a driving force in my learning and exploration. I am fascinated by the potential of AI to solve complex problems and enhance human capabilities. I am continuously learning about machine learning, deep learning, and exploring how AI can be ethically and effectively integrated into various aspects of life.</p>
