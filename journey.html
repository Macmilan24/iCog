                <h3>Early Life &amp; Education</h3>
                <p>Born on July 31, 2003, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, my early years were shaped by a curious mind and a growing fascination with how things work.  Growing up in Addis Ababa, I was immersed in a vibrant culture and a rapidly evolving technological landscape, which sparked my initial interest in technology.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am pursuing my Computer Science degree at Unity University. My studies have provided me with a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and computer systems.  This academic journey is crucial in building the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue my passion for creating impactful technological solutions.</p>

                <h3>Professional Experiences &amp; Growth</h3>
                <p>My journey in the tech world is actively unfolding through practical experiences. I am currently an intern at ICOG Labs, where I am gaining valuable hands-on experience in [mention specific area if you want, or keep it general like: software development, AI applications, etc.]. This internship allows me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects and collaborate with experienced professionals.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, my involvement with A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) is proving to be an enriching experience. As an A2SVian, I am part of a community focused on fostering tech talent and bridging the gap to global opportunities. This has provided me with networking opportunities, mentorship, and a broader perspective on the global tech landscape.</p>
