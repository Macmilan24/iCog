# Personal Website: My Life Documentation

This is a simple 3-page personal website designed to document my life journey, experiences, and aspirations in a clean, documentation-style format.

## Pages

The website consists of three pages:

1.  **Introduction (index.html):**
    *   Serves as the homepage and provides a welcoming introduction to who I am and the purpose of this website.
    *   Includes a brief bio, a profile image, and navigation links to other pages.

2.  **My Journey (journey.html):**
    *   Details my life journey, experiences, and key milestones.
    *   Organized into sections like Early Life & Education, Professional Experiences, and Interests & Skills.
    *   Uses headings, paragraphs, and lists to present information in a structured and readable way.

3.  **Future & Contact (future.html):**
    *   Focuses on my future aspirations, goals, and how to get in touch.
    *   Includes sections on future plans and contact information (email, social media links).

## Style and Theme

The website is styled to resemble a modern documentation site, inspired by the design of the Next.js documentation. Key stylistic features include:

*   **Clean and Readable Typography:** Using system fonts for a consistent and modern look.
*   **Light Background with Dark Text:** Designed for readability and a professional appearance.
*   **Primary Color Accents:**  Using a blue color for headings, links, and interactive elements to highlight key information.
*   **Structured Layout:** Utilizing sections, headings, and whitespace to create a well-organized and easy-to-navigate website.
*   **CSS Styling:**  All pages are styled using a single CSS file (`style.css`) to maintain consistency and a unified theme.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:**  Structure and content of the website pages (`index.html`, `journey.html`, `future.html`).
*   **CSS:**  Styling and visual presentation of the website (`style.css`).
